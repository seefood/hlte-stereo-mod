# hlte-stereo-mod
Stereo mod for the Samsung Galaxy Note3 (hlte and maybe other variants)

These files were found "in the wild" on chat groups and forums, they come with
no owner information nor license, so I assume they are public domain until
proven otherwise.

The usage instructions given:
1. Plop audio-policy.conf under /System/vendor/etc with mods 0644 (you'll probably need root access for that)
2. If you have "weird sound problems" (sic), do the same with mixer_paths.xml as well.

That's how I found it, no warranty, no origin, just reposting it here for convenience.
